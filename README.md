# Building Footprint Detection in Cambodia using YOLOv7

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv7 for detecting building footprints in satellite images across Cambodia. This project aims to leverage deep learning to enhance urban planning and monitoring urban sprawl effectively.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to apply the YOLOv7 object detection model to identify and map buildings from satellite imagery. This approach helps in understanding urban layouts, planning urban infrastructure, and monitoring developments over time.

## Features

- **YOLOv7 Integration:** Utilizes the cutting-edge YOLOv7 model for accurate detection of buildings.
- **High-Resolution Satellite Imagery:** Processes high-resolution images to extract detailed footprint data.
- **Automated Workflow:** Streamlines the process from image acquisition to processing and output.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.8 or later
- OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Satellite images dataset (format and source details)
